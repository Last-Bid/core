Hey Guys, this’ll be the start of a new series of blogs I’m making about this new company I’m starting along with Jordan Rimmer. A bit about myself and my co-founder.
I grew up in Hamilton, New Zealand. Attending St Paul’s, before later moving to Auckland to finish up my secondary education at Auckland International College and my CompSci Degree from The University of Auckland.
I started my work in the tech field with a start up company that worked on storage software, dealing with typical start up problems and having the opportunity to wear many different hats. From provisioning IT infrastructure, QA Testing to building CI pipelines with Jenkins and later working on a team that used C/C++ to develop low level software that dealt heavily with read/write IOPS performance.
Later, I found myself wanting to work with something closer to the consumer. I felt the need to create something in which that regular people could actually use. So I quit my job, and began teaching myself full-stack web development full time and very quickly I found myself being offered a job as a Full-Stack Developer, which I’m currently still doing.
I had a dream, it’s all I ever wanted. Is to create something tangible, to say that I own this and this business i’m starting is my opportunity to show that. I plan on documenting my progress here for everyone to follow along, whether it ends up as a success or failure.
We’re creating X for Y etc.
