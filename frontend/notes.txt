## Redux

Store - Reducer - Action
(State) - (Interprets Action) - (Action)

## Three Principles
1) State is stored in an object tree within a single store
2) Emit an action (object describing) to change state
3) Pure reducers (functions) that change state based on actions

Store -> App -> Action -> Reducer -> Store

// store
getState()
dispatch(action)
subscribe(listener)
