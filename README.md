# PROJECT SNIPE

This project aims to create an engaging e-commerce platform to enable online shoppers to have a better experience shopping online.
The platform will be powered by time-limited product listings that will expire within 30 minutes. Our intelligent code will scan and retrieve
listings from popular online auction websites such as TradeMe, Amazon or Ebay and present the deals in an easy to consume
appearance for the end user. The biggest priority for us is to ensure we create an amazing customer experience. By drawing inspiration from sites
such as Wish, Massdrop and Tinder we plan to make use of the latest CX technologies.

### Our Goal

Our goal is create a engaging tool to help customers buy miscellaneous products they would have otherwise not purchased.
Taking inspiration from websites such as Wish, MassDrop and combining it with E-commerce platforms such as TradeMe and Amazon. 
The purpose of Project Snipe is to create a platform whereby users can browse and acquire goods at cost. 

### Design

From a UX perspective we want to create an engaging platform, where customers default to browsing when they want to seek
good deals or are just bored. To do this, we will responsively design the platform to create a swipe centric style interface for mobile
and infinite scrolling style interface for desktop.

### Software Architecture

Software architecture is a core concern of ours so we want to make sure we do it right from the start. We'll create a 
decoupled software architecture on a cloud platform. This allows us the flexibility to expand in the native mobile application space
with no extra technical costs while also affording us the scalability needed to cater to sudden surges of customers which 
is common in th e-commerce space due to special holidays or seasons.
